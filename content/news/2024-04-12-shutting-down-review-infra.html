title: Shutting down the video review infrastructure
---

<p>If you haven't reviewed your talk, now is the time</p>

---MORE---

<p> As of now, there 26 (out of 855) talks still not reviewed for
FOSDEM 2024. We need to shut down some large parts of the infrastructure
that we keep for the event, which is currently only idling and
consuming resources :)</p>

<p> Thus, we ask all remaining talks to be reviewed. We'll be shutting
down the hardware in a week (around the 19th of April) and then
it'll be close to impossible to review your videos, any latecomers
will be provided with raw files and a link to the <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/documentation.html">FFMPEG documentation</a>.</p>

<p> The current state of all talks is visible at
<a href="https://review.video.fosdem.org/overview">our review
	overview page</a>.</p>
